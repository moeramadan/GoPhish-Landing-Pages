If at the time you import the HTML code and the Microsoft logo is not showing at the top, the image link in the code might be dead. I've provided the Microsoft logo in the Microsoft-o365-Landing-Page folder under "logo.png". Please upload it yourself to Imgur or IMGBB, and replace the link in the HTML code with the image's PNG link.
